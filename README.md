# Asana-Demo: Marketing Campaign Project

This is a small demo project created in Asana to showcase my ability to use Asana for project management.

*About Asana:*
Asana is a powerful tool for tracking tasks, managing deadlines, and collaborating across teams. It helps organize work clearly and efficiently.

**Demo Details: 
The project covers a Marketing Campaign with upcoming work, tasks in progress, and planning phases. Each task has assigned due dates, priorities, statuses, and budgets.

This demo illustrates how Asana can be tailored to different departments and project types in a professional setting.
